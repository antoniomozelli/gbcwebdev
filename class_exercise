<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
    Digital Artist with expertise in User Experience, Mobile Development, Virtual Reality Development, and media production. Graduated in Computer Science from the FUMEC University, Brazil and in Visual Arts from the Guignard School, Estate University of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
</p> 
 

<p>
    2015, I am a member of the Brazilian research group on Art, Science and Technology, LAB|Front, where I could develop several digital art projects, exploring the use of immersive virtual reality and creative coding. In addition, I participated in research projects focussing on the Digital Humanities aspects and challenges. I am also part of the Brazilian Digital Arts Seminar technical committee.
</p> 

<p>
    The Human-Computer Interaction field was always my favourite one. Having the chance to pursue a degree in Computer Science and then in Visual Arts, made me realize how important is to STEM graduate students to develop empathy through a digital humanities formation. I strongly believe in the intersection of both study areas.
