                    Since 2015, I am a member of the Brazilian research group on Art, Science and Technology, LAB|Front, where I could develop several digital art projects, exploring the use of immersive virtual reality and creative coding. In addition, I participated in research projects focussing on the Digital Humanities aspects and challenges. I am also part of the Brazilian Digital Arts Seminar technical committee.

                    The Human-Computer Interaction field was always my favourite one. Having the chance to pursue a degree in Computer Science and then in Visual Arts, made me realize how important is to STEM graduate students to develop empathy through a digital humanities formation. I strongly believe in the intersection of both study areas.
